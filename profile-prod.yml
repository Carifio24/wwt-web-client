# A prefix to prepend to paths for links to the "user website", which will look

# served from /webclient/ and they're in the root, so:

# A prefix to prepend to paths for links to the WWT Communities, which will look
# like "/Resource" before prefixing. On the production server, the Communities
# and "user website" are both in the same place, but in testing we might split
# them out.

# A URL prefix for "core static" data files, which are unchanging data served

# in production.

# The URL prefix for finding the Web engine. In production, we want to route
# this through the CDN. In development we want to use the testing version or
# perhaps even a local hacked version.

# XXX TEMPORARY: we should point at a fixed version in production, but for now
# we're pointing at the "latest" version since we're iterating quickly.

# This string gets munged into CSS and JS references to potentially referenced

#
# XXX TEMPORARY: during beta-testing of the new web framework, we're not
# using minified versions to help debugging.
